Behaviors:

Interactive usage tracker/menu planner retro: 
Ask user for input and assist in labeling and catagorizing it:

"Hi! What did you have to eat for {class meal} {date today}?"
"That sounds great. What were the {class ingredients (String name, int typeOfIngredient with a map from 0 to whatever and then add in customs with the NEXTINT as a value)}? You can write them all in, and separate each ingredient with a comma!"
"What {class amount (int pieces double weight} of {ingredient} did you use?" (etc.)?
"Is that ingredient a {drink}, {fluid}, {starch}, {protein}, {vegetable}, {fruit}, {fat}, {sweetener}, {spice}, or something {else}?"
"How many people were eating {meal} with you {today}?"
"Was it a {special} {occassion}?"
IF YES
"Oo, fun! What's the {occassion}?"
"How often does {occassion} happen? You can say {weekly}, {monthly}, {yearly}, or {on demand}!"

Intake a current file with the eating log info and spit out a file with aggregated shopping values for a selected
{timePeriod} so that if next week is the same as this one, for instance, I can already know what my
{usage} will be. 

Interactive pantry catalog:

"Hi! "

A {pantry} is just a name, a key id (can this be a state?), and a date on which it was there)
Function to compare what is in the {pantry} with the {usage} file of a given {timePeriod}. Produces a {shoppingList}.
